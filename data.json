Dodson clutches as attaché case close to him and scans the cafe furtively. Nedry laughs, shakes his head, and waves to him. “Dodgson!” Dodgson hurries over to the table. “You shouldn’t use my name.” “Dodgson, Dodgson! We got Dodgson here! See, nobody cares. Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?”</p>\n<p>God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs. Dinosaurs eat man… woman inherits the earth.</p>\n<p>I was overwhelmed by the power of this place; but I made a mistake, too. I didn’t have enough respect for that power and it’s out now. The only thing that matters now are the people we love: Alan and Lex and Tim. John, they’re out there where people are dying.</p>\n",
    "text_2": "<p>Muldoon whisks in through the double doors. Hammond is right behind him. They go straight to the main console, where RAY ARNOLD fortyish, a chronic worrier and chain-smoker, is seated. “National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm about seventy-five miles west of us.” Hammond sighs and looks over Arnold’s shoulder. “Why didn’t I build in Orlando?” “I’ll keep an eye on it. Maybe it’ll swing south like the last one.” “Ray, start the tour program.” He punches a button on the console. “Hold on to your butts!”</p>\n<p>You know the first attraction I ever built when I came down south from Scotland? It was a Flea Circus, Petticoat Lane. Really quite wonderful. We had a wee trapeze, and ah, a merry-go - -a carousel - - and a seesaw. They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas. “I see the fleas, mummy! Can’t you see the fleas?” Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade… But with this place, I wanted to show them something that wasn’t an illusion, something that was real, something they could see and touch. An aim not devoid of merit.</p>\n<p>“Dr. Grant, my dear Dr. Sattler. Welcome to Jurassic Park.” They turn and look at the view again. It’s beautiful vista, reminiscent of an African plain. A whole herd of dinosaurs crosses the plain, maybe a hundred that we see in a quick glance alone. “Ellie, they’re absolutely - - they’re moving in herds. They do move in herds!” “We were right!” “How did you do it?! How did you do this?!”</p>\n<p>A snake slithers across a tree branch, past what looks like the large iris of a flower. The flower blinks. It’s the eye of the raptor. Muldoon sees it. He raises his gun. Instead of running away again, the raptor rises slowly out of the brush, fully revealing itself to Muldoon, hissing at him. The corners of Muldoon’s mouth twitch up into a smile. He draws a bead on the animal. His finger tenses on the trigger. Suddenly, his smile vanishes, both eyes pop open, and a terrible thought sweeps across his face. His eyes flick to the side “Clever girl”</p>\n",
